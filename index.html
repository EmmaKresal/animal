            <h3>| Elephant Biology |</h3> 
            <p>Elephant, is the largest living land animal, characterized by its long trunk (elongated upper lip and nose), columnar legs, and huge head with temporal glands and wide, flat ears. Elephants are grayish to brown in colour, and their body hair is sparse and coarse. The trunk, also called a proboscis, and is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects </p>

            <h3>| Elephant Behavior |</h3>    
            <p>They rely on a social network for survival. Elephants are about as friendly as humans. Very social animals. Reproducing 22 month gestation period and only gives birth every 5 years. successfully raising their offspring is critical to their survival. successfully raising their offspring is critical to their survival. All elephant species are herbivores, consuming only plant material such as grass, leaves, twigs, fruits, ect.</p>

        <p>They are found most often in savannas, grasslands, and forests but occupy a wide range of habitats, including deserts, swamps, and highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are very adaptable to their surrounds. African Elephants clear away trees and plants so that new forms of vegetation can grow there and they form emigrational paths that they continue to follow year after year. This allows them to take advantage of the foods that grow in various areas.

        <p>For the most part, elephants react very well to humans. Yet the won’t tolerate being treated terribly. In many areas of the world including Asia, elephants are working animals. They are well cared for though with days off in between to help them cope. Humans are the only real predators of elephants destroying habitats and hunting the animals for game and thats when they don’t get along.</p>
